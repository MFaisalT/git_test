# Stage 3 - Script and complete timed audiovisual storyboard

Your responsibility: turn the selected premise and hook into a shootable script and a timed storyboard that a generation tool can be prompted from. Every scene needs complete direction. The deterministic validator will reject gaps, overlaps, missing camera/audio, >1 cut per clip, infeasible speech (>3.3 words/s), undeclared props, and total duration off target by more than max(1 s, 10%).

## Brief
{{BRIEF}}
## Bible
{{BIBLE}}
## Selected premise and hook
{{CONTEXT}}

## Rules
- Scenes tile [0, duration_target_s] exactly: first start_s = 0, each start_s = previous end_s, last end_s = target.
- Each scene: location, action, performance (an invested task, not an emotion adjective), microexpression, camera {shot, lens, movement, rig}, lighting (key direction + colour bounce + contact shadows), environment, sound {ambience, foley[], music, voice}, transition_out, props_from_frame_one, cuts_inside_clip (0 or 1), generation_unit (which clip this belongs to; clips are 4-30 s).
- One on-camera speaker per scene at most; a second voice is off-camera.
- Signature gesture at most once. The bible's rule must cause the payoff.
- Continuity: restate identity anchors verbatim from the bible; list every moving prop; costume per episode.
- No readable brand text, logos or real-app UI. No researched creator's identity markers.
<<IF SILENT>>
- Silent gag: dialogue arrays must be empty. Use timed action, facial performance, camera, ambience, a reveal, and a loop-friendly final pose.
<<ENDIF SILENT>>
<<IF SPOKEN>>
- Dialogue lines fit their scene at <=2.8 words/s. Write for the ear: short lines, no thesis sentences.
<<ENDIF SPOKEN>>
<<IF COMMERCIAL>>
- Commercial: product solves or escalates the story problem; include disclosure_line and a disclosure_plan entry; use only verified facts {{COMMERCIAL_FACTS}}; never imply the character used or benefited from it. Forbidden topics: {{FORBIDDEN}}.
<<ENDIF COMMERCIAL>>

## Craft rules (distilled from the content-engine and ugc-influencer-video skills; added after the 2026-10-07 bake-off)
- Hook earns the next second: the most specific word or image first; no warm-up.
- Camera alive, never "tripod": propped phone with one settle-wobble, handheld bob, or placement-open; angle changes come from the character, not cuts.
- Performance = an invested task (goal, obstacle, tactic) with eye-work as action; emotion adjectives are not direction.
- Lighting names key direction, fill, one colour bounce from a named surface and contact shadows; add a light-stability line if the light must not change.
- Audio names ambience plus 3-5 diegetic foley per scene; music none by default.
- The payoff must re-read the opening; the camera notices before the character does.
<<IF COMMERCIAL>>
- disclosure_plan must include all three: the platform's paid-partnership/branded-content tool, a spoken or caption disclosure line, and the AI/fictional-character label.
<<ENDIF COMMERCIAL>>

Self-check before answering: timings tile exactly; every scene has camera.shot/lens/movement and sound.ambience; props used appear in continuity.props; speech rate; one cut max; silent means no dialogue.
