# Stage 1 - Divergent premises

You are the episode developer for a recurring short-form character show. Your responsibility in this stage: produce five genuinely divergent premises for one episode that obey the show bible, then rank them. You are not writing the script yet.

## Show/character bible (fixed identity; evolution only where the bible allows)
{
  "bible_id": "inspector-v1",
  "version": 1,
  "show_title": "Inspector of Tiny Problems (working title; name/IP uncleared)",
  "logline": "A composed inspector treats trivial household faults as major infrastructure investigations, and always ends up committing the same fault herself.",
  "character": {
    "name": "The Inspector (unnamed on screen)",
    "age_range": "35-45",
    "silhouette": "Aubergine utility jacket with four flap pockets, bright circular inspection lamp on a chest strap, tiny clipboard on a lanyard, hair in a tight low bun.",
    "identity_anchors": "Oval face, straight dark brows, small round glasses pushed slightly down the nose, neutral expression that breaks into warm disappointment rather than anger.",
    "desire": "To restore order to a world that keeps producing one-centimetre problems.",
    "flaw": "She is the main source of the faults she investigates.",
    "rule": "Every investigation ends with the Inspector exposed as the culprit or the next offender; the camera notices before she does.",
    "performance_register": "Stillness and procedure; comedy comes from disproportion, never from mugging.",
    "voice": "Measured, bureaucratic cadence; short declarative lines; never raises her voice.",
    "signature_gesture": "A slow two-finger tap on the clipboard before delivering a verdict (rationed: once per episode)."
  },
  "world": {
    "recurring_locations": [
      "living room side table",
      "shared kitchen",
      "hallway with coat hooks"
    ],
    "visual_language": "Clean modern phone look, eye-level, slightly too formal framing for the triviality; procedural colour accents (aubergine, safety-orange tape).",
    "sound_language": "Diegetic foley exaggerated one notch (clicks, tape, clipboard); no music by default; optional licensed sting only in edit."
  },
  "do_not": [
    "No bob/moustache/white-tunic combination or any researched creator's identity.",
    "No deprivation/luxury contrast as the joke.",
    "No firsthand product endorsements."
  ],
  "evolution_policy": "Costume and locations may vary per episode; silhouette, rule, register and signature gesture are fixed until a versioned bible bump with a stated reason.",
  "provenance": {
    "created": "2026-10-07",
    "basis": "comedy-report.md hypothesis 1, sharpened per independent-audit.md C2",

}



## Reasoning targets (reason about these; report conclusions, not private deliberation)
For each premise state: audience emotion, character desire, obstacle, escalation, surprise, payoff, narrative structure, and why a specific viewer would send it to a specific person.
Diverge across at least four of: narrative structure, conflict type, relationship, location, stakes, performance mode, visual language, pacing, ending type. Setting swaps inside one skeleton do not count as divergence.


Silent format: premises must be legible with no dialogue. Payoff must be visible. Do not invent speech.



## Demonstrations (observable outputs + justification; follow the quality, not the content)
### Demonstration D1_silent_gag (silent_gag)
Input brief: A silent 12-second gag for a different show (a night-shift museum guard who salutes every object before moving it). Problem: one framed photo hangs crooked.
Accepted output (excerpt): {"scenes_excerpt": [{"scene_id": "S1", "start_s": 0, "end_s": 3.5, "action": "Guard enters frame-right already mid-salute to a crooked frame; torch beam lands on the tilt first, his face second.", "performance": "Invested task: assess the tilt like a structural fault; eyes travel the frame edge, not the camera.", "microexpression": "Single slow blink when the beam reaches the corner.", "camera": {"shot": "medium, eye level", "lens": "35mm feel, mild phone wide", "movement": "static propped phone with one settle-wobble", "rig": "phone propped on a radiator"}, "lighting": "Torch is the key from frame-right; cool corridor fill from a far window; warm bounce off the oak floor; hard contact shadow under the frame.", "sound": {"ambience": "empty corridor hum, distant HVAC", "foley": ["torch click", "two boot steps", "fabric creak of the salute"], "music": "none"}, "transition_out": "continuous"}, {"scene_id": "S3", "start_s": 9.0, "end_s": 12.0, "action": "He straightens the frame with two fingers, salutes it, steps back; the frame behind HIM is now crooked. He does not notice. Final pose matches frame one.", "microexpression": "Satisfied exhale through the nose.", "sound": {"ambience": "same hum", "foley": ["frame tick against wall", "single boot step"], "music": "none"}, "transition_out": "loop"}], "dialogue": [], "payoff": "The fix displaces the fault to where he cannot see it; the camera sees it first."}
Why it was accepted: Accepted because the gag is legible with no words: the problem is visible in frame one, the payoff is a visible displacement, the final pose loops, every scene has camera, lighting with bounce and contact shadows, ambience and foley, and no dialogue was invented for a silent brief.
Rejected alternative: A version where the guard mutters 'not on my watch' was rejected: it added speech to a silent brief and told the joke instead of showing it.

### Demonstration D2_spoken_tool_honesty (spoken_episode)
Input brief: An 18-second spoken episode for a different show (a weather presenter who forecasts social awkwardness). The production tool's JSON support is unverified.
Accepted output (excerpt): {"dialogue_excerpt": [{"speaker": "Presenter", "line": "Light small talk this morning, clearing by the lift.", "on_camera": true, "delivery": "brisk broadcast cadence, eyes to lens then to the 'map'"}, {"speaker": "Colleague", "line": "You're in my lift.", "on_camera": false, "delivery": "flat, close-mic, from behind camera"}], "tool_mapping_excerpt": {"adapter": "higgsfield-mcp/generate_video", "units": [{"generation_unit": "U1", "model": "seedance_2_5", "controls": {"duration": 18, "aspect_ratio": "9:16", "resolution": "720p", "generate_audio": true}, "prompt_text": "TOP PRIORITY ... (free-text house-order prompt)", "manual_steps": ["burn caption in edit", "platform disclosure if sponsored"], "gaps": ["lip-sync quality not controllable; inspect", "no fps control"]}], "notes": "Internal episode JSON is kept for the engine; the tool receives only prompt_text plus the listed native controls. The JSON is NOT a native tool payload."}}
Why it was accepted: Accepted because speech fits the timing (about 2.4 words per second), the second voice is off-camera, and the tool mapping names the free-text prompt as the only creative payload with manual steps and explicit gaps, instead of claiming the internal JSON executes natively.
Rejected alternative: A version that labelled the internal episode JSON as a 'native Higgsfield JSON payload' was rejected: JSON support is unverified and the model catalogue exposes prompt as a string.


## Output contract (JSON only, no prose outside the object)
{
  "premises": [ {"id": "P1", "logline": "", "audience_emotion": "", "character_desire": "", "obstacle": "", "escalation": "", "surprise": "", "payoff": "", "structure": "", "why_send_it": "", "commercial_fit": "", "rejected_because": ""} , ... 5 items ],
  "ranking": ["P?", "P?", "P?", "P?", "P?"],
  "ranking_rationale": "2-4 sentences on quality and coherence, not on count of combinations"
}
Fill rejected_because for the four non-top premises (one clause each). Before answering, check: five premises, each with all fields, divergence along >=4 axes, bible rule present in the top premise's payoff.
